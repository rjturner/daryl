*How to Become a Rainmaker* by Jeffrey J. Cook is a blow-by-blow best practices book on sales. And it's a keeper, I think I will buy it.

*Rainmaker* is tricky to synthesize because it is chock-full of superb sales advice--over 50 mini-chapters on everything from killer sales questions to eliminating unnecessary risks, like fancy pens in a breast pockets. He is masterful of language and psychology, creating a chain of agreement, proffering new information to let customers change minds but keep face, and challenging customers' sense of empowerment ("Why can't you?").

Much of the advice is germane, but Cook's advice to measure your mileage and prioritize really challenged by existing biases. If you can only make 300 sales calls in a year and it takes 20 sales calls on a prospect to get the sale, then don't dilute your effort contacting every weak prospect in the territory, even 19 times. (See chapters 21 & 22).

In the epilogue, Cook challenges you to open and random page and actually do the recommendation. In that spirit, here are three things I will try in the coming days:

1. Preplan every sales call in detail.
2. Prioritize my prospects; seek the biggest and most successful clients, they have the most money.
3. Measure my mileage and don't run out of gas.

I invite you not to read, but to do.
